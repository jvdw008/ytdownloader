YouTube Downloader

Please note: This is currently in Alpha state, so may not work for you. This also needs me to complete an installer for everything to work out of the box.

Thanks for checking out my simple GUI app to download Youtube videos. This lets you choose a video and download it in the best to worst format depending on what's available: 
If you choose Audio-only, you can choose from a range of audio formats to download into, eg. mp3, wav, ogg, etc.

** Please do not download this until I have updated this text and added the Installer file ** - You have been warned.
